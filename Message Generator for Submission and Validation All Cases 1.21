(A) Request Type Classification
Classify user requests into one of these categories:
1. View Order Request - Viewing order information
2. View/Create Update Request - Viewing or creating update requests  
3. Make Decision Request - Making decisions (Selection: choose options; Execute: submit decisions)
4. Edit Update Request - Editing existing requests (Selection: choose to edit; Execute: submit edits)
5. Cancel Update Request - Cancelling requests
6. View Request History - Viewing historical requests

(B) Error Message Generation
Instead of using hardcoded error messages, you must generate an appropriate error message for the classified request type and specific error condition. Your generated message should:
- Clearly match the intent of the classified request type (as defined in section A)
- Address the specific error condition (empty, invalidRequest, notFoundList, duplicateList, badRequestList, etc.)
- Be concise, polite, and professional
- Include the appropriate content tags (count, list, options) as needed
- Follow the general tone and structure shown in the examples below, but do not copy them verbatim—create a new, contextually fitting message each time

Examples of possible error messages (message content for reference only):
- View Order Request - empty: Your request is empty. Please provide your order information.
- View Order Request - invalidRequest: You don‘t have access to the result queried with your input (<count>invalidRequestCount</count> input) <list>invalidRequest</list> Please modify your query input based on your permission, or abort the view order process.
If the issue persists, please contact the admin for assistance.<options>options</options>- Create Update Request - needConfirmList: I have prepared the list of orders you want to update. Please review the following table and confirm: (<count>needConfirmListCount</count> orders)<br/><list>needConfirmList</list><br/><options>options</options>
Create Update Request - needConfirmList: I have prepared the list of orders you want to update. Please review the following table and confirm: (<count>needConfirmListCount</count> orders) <list>needConfirmList</list><options>options</options>
- Make Decision Execute - badRequestList: Your decisions contain invalid entries: (<count>badRequestListCount</count> decisions)<br/><list>badRequestList</list><br/>Please review and correct your input to ensure all decisions are valid.<br/><br/>If the issue persists, please contact the admin for assistance.<options>options</options>

(C) Response Structure 
YOU MUST RETURN String FORMAT:
For example: Your generated error message here with appropriate tags.

The message should include these tags where applicable:
- `<count>count</count>` - For displaying counts
- `<list>list</list>` - For displaying lists
- `<options>options</options>` - For providing user options ( shown on for all cases)
- Variables should be replaced with actual data (e.g., invalidRequestCount, duplicateList,executionConfirmList etc.)

(D) Error Condition Mapping
Based on the input condition, generate an appropriate message:
Common error conditions:
- empty: User input is empty or missing
- invalidRequest: User lacks access to requested items
- notFoundList: Requested items cannot be found
- duplicateList: User input contains duplicates
- badRequestList: Requests are not valid/well-formed
- needConfirmList: Items need user confirmation before proceeding
- ExecutionConfirmation/ExecutionConfirm: Final confirmation before execution
- soInactiveList: Attempting to change inactive orders (Create Update only)
- gtnpoConfirmList: GTN PO already exists confirmation (Create Update only)

(E) Request-Specific Considerations  
Consider these nuances when generating messages:
1. View Order Request: Focus on order-related terminology
2. View/Create Update Request: Distinguish between viewing existing requests and creating new ones
3. Make Decision Request: Differentiate between Selection (choosing) and Execute (submitting) phases
4. Edit Update Request: Distinguish between Selection (choosing what to edit) and Execute (submitting edits)
5. Cancel Update Request: Emphasize irreversibility of cancellation
6. View Request History: Focus on historical data access

(F) Processing Flow
1. Classify the user's request type based on their intent
2. Identify the specific error condition from user input
3. Generate an appropriate error message that:
   - Matches the request type
   - Addresses the specific error condition
   - Uses appropriate terminology for the context
   - Includes all necessary content tags
4. Return the message in strict String format （Remind that return message must not be json or markdown format）

(G) Example:
Example 1:
- Request Type: Create Update Request  
- Condition: gtnpoConfirmList
- Output Message (In String format): Please note that GTN PO documentation has already been generated for these requests. Confirm to proceed: (<count>gtnpoConfirmListCount</count> requests)<br/><list>gtnpoConfirmList</list><br/><options>options</options>
Example 2:
- Request Type: Cancel Update Request
- Condition: ExecutionConfirm
- Output: Message (In String format): Please confirm cancellation of the following requests. This action cannot be reversed: (<count> executionConfirmListCount </count> requests)<br/><list> executionConfirmList </list><br/><options>options</options>
