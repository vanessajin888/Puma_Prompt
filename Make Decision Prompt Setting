9. userAction:
   (a) Type: String
   (b) Description:
     Overview
The userAction parameter is used to identify the user's operational intent within the conversation flow. This specification defines the userAction values corresponding to various user inputs and the rules for setting related parameters.

1. Basic Status Determination Rules
(1) Rule One: Change Operation

Trigger Condition: The user input contains any of the following keywords:
"add"
"remove"
"remove all"
"change"
Parameter Settings:
userAction: "change"
confirmAll: false
(2) Rule Two: Confirm Operation

Trigger Condition: The user input contains the keyword "confirm"
Parameter Settings:
userAction: "confirm"
confirmAll: true
filters: null
decisions: null
(3) Rule Three: Abort Operation

Trigger Condition: The user input contains the keyword "abort"
Parameter Settings:
userAction: "abort"
removeAll: false
filters: null
decisions: null
(4) Rule Four: First Query

Trigger Condition: The current user query is the first message in the conversation
Parameter Settings:
userAction: null
Example
User's first query: "I wanna reject/approve/make my decision with Customer PO 101632 and GTN PO Item 1000"
Then: userAction = null

(5) Rule Five: No Matching Operation

Trigger Condition: The user input does not meet any of the above conditions
Parameter Settings:
userAction: null
2. Special Handling for Non-First Queries
Add Operation During Confirmation Stage
The current input is treated as an add operation when all of the following conditions are met:

The user's query is not a completely new request;
The conversation is in a confirmation stage (i.e., resumeStage indicates a pending confirmation state);
The user has not made a final confirm/abort/remove decision;
The intent tool used in the current query is the same as in the previous query;
The user provides additional parameters.
Parameter Settings:

userAction: "change"
3. Special Logic for the Decision Workflow
Two Confirmation Stages of the Decision Tool
The decision workflow includes two independent confirmation stages, each corresponding to a different query pattern:

Stage One: Filter Requests

Query Pattern:
Query 1: "I wanna approve my decision with [field] [value]"
Supported Filter Fields:
SO Number, Customer PO, GTN PO, GTN PO Item, Batch ID, Request ID, Related Request
Add Operation Example:
After Query 1, if the user does not perform a confirm/abort/remove operation but instead inputs Query 2: "I (also) wanna (add to) make my decision with [field] [value]"

Query 2 is treated as an add operation
userAction: "change"
Stage Two: Execute Decision

Query Pattern:
Query 3: "I wanna [decision type] the request with [field] [value]"
Parameter Requirements:
[field]: Only "Request ID"
[value]: The corresponding request ID value
[decision type]: "approve" or "reject"
User on make decision stage, so userAction = null
Example:
"I wanna approve the request with request id rd_26c745ec-34ab-443a-bd7e-70607a2cc9c7_0"
then userAction = null;

Add Operation Example:
After Query 3, the user should enter the second confirmation stage. If the user does not perform a confirm/abort/remove operation but instead inputs Query 4: "I (also) wanna (add to) approve/reject my decision with [field] [value]"

It is also treated as an add operation
userAction: "change"
4. Comprehensive Examples
Example 1: Adding Parameters During Confirmation Stage

Previous Query: I want to make decision on SO 423542635

filters: ["{\"SO Number\": \"423542635\"}"]
userAction: Determined based on the initial query
Current Input: I want to make decision on GTN PO aaa

Analysis: Non-first query. The user should have entered the confirmation stage but has not performed confirm/abort/remove, and uses the same intent tool.
Determination: Meets all conditions for a non-first query add operation.
Parameter Settings:
filters: ["{\"GTN PO\": \"aaa\"}"]
addList: ["{\"GTN PO\": \"aaa\"}"]
userAction: "change"
Example 2: Stage Transition in Decision Workflow

Query 1: I wanna approve my decision with SO Number 101974

filters: ["{\"SO Number\": \"101974\"}"]
Enters first-stage confirmation
userAction = null
Query 2 (During first-stage confirmation): I also wanna add to make my decision with GTN PO 4602602420

At this point, the user should input "confirm"/"abort"/"remove", but the actual input is an add operation, therefore it is determined as add behavior.
filters: ["{\"GTN PO\": \"4602602420\"}"]
addList: ["{\"GTN PO\": \"4602602420\"}"]
userAction: "change"
Query 3 (After first-stage confirmation is completed): I wanna approve the request with request id rd_26c745ec-34ab-443a-bd7e-70607a2cc9c7_0

decisions: ["{\"Request ID\": \"rd_26c745ec-34ab-443a-bd7e-70607a2cc9c7_0\", \"Approver Decision\": \"Approved\"}"]
Enters second-stage confirmation
Query 4 (During second-stage confirmation): I wanna add to approve with request id rd_bbced569-33b4-400a-88ae-e77e53754803

decisions: Contains decision information for both requests
addList: ["{\"Request ID\": \"rd_bbced569-33b4-400a-88ae-e77e53754803\"}", "{\"Approver Decision\": \"Approved\"}"]
userAction: "change"

10. removeAll:
   (a) Type: Boolean
   (b) Description:
   if user type "remove all" then set it to true;  otherwise, set to false
   Remind: If removeAll = true, then useAction must be "change" 

11. column:
   (a) Type: Array
   (b) Description:
     An array of column wants to extract
     column:
     (1) Utilize user-specified column names when provided; otherwise, set to `null`
     (2) Preserve previous column selections from latest history record when no new preferences are specified
     (3) Supported column fields: "Batch ID",
     "Request ID","Product Division","Supplier Code","Sale Sub Code","GTN PO","GTN PO Item","Customer PO","SO Number","SO Item Number","Change Type","New Value","Approver","Request Status","Requestor Comment","Auto Approve","Is Valid Input","Latest Decided By","Latest Approver Role",
     "Latest Approver Comment","Requestor","Observer"
   (c) Array Item Type: String
   (d) Array Item Description: column key that wants to extract
12. addList:
   (a) Type: Array
   (b) Description:
  Define an array of objects. Extract "add" operations from the current user input (user new message) as an array of objects in the format:  
`["{"Key":"Value"}", ...]`
Remind: Extract all applicable add conditions from the user's current input into an array (from user new message, please don't extract value from history record)

Rules:
1. When `userAction == "change"`, set `addList == filters`.
2. Related keywords for extraction include: "add", "also want to add".
3. If `userAction == "abort"` or `userAction == "confirm"` or `removeAll == true`, set `addList` to `null`.

Special Handling for Non-New Queries:
If the user’s query is not a new query and occurs during a confirmation stage (i.e., the user does not make a confirm/abort decision but inputs a query) and the query intention tool remains the same as the previous query’s intention tool, then treat the current input as an add operation.

Example:
- Previous Query: `I want to make decision on So 423542635`
- Current User Input: `I want to make a decision on gtn po aaa`  
→ This is not a new query.  
→ `filters`: `["{"GTN PO": "aaa"}"]`  
→ `addList`: `["{"GTN PO": "aaa"}"]
but if the user current query is "I wanna approve the request with ..." or silimar query, it is not add condition

   (c) Array Item Type: String
   (d) a JSON object string contain filter keys and value

13. filters:
   (a) Type: Array
   (b) Description:
1.Overview
The `filters` array contains filter conditions that are extracted exclusively from the current user message. Do not extract filters from any previous conversation history.

2. Extraction Logic

Trigger Condition：
Extract filters from the current user message if and only if:
- The message contains phrases such as: "make decision", "make a decision", "make decisions", or similar variations.
- OR the message contains any of these specific keywords: `"SO Number"`, `"Customer PO"`, `"GTN PO"`, `"GTN PO Item"`, `"Batch ID"`, `"Related Request"`.

If these conditions are not met, do not extract any filters.

3.Format
The extracted filters must be formatted as an array of JSON strings:
"filters": ["{\"Key\":\"Value\"}"]

4.Special Cases & State Handling
（1）- No filters found: Set to empty array `"filters": []`
- Confirmation with `confirmAll`: When `confirmAll == true` and `userAction = "confirm"`, set `"filters": null`
- User aborts: When `userAction = "abort"`, set `"filters": []`
- Remove all filters: When `removeAll = true`, set `"filters": []`

（2） Supported Filter Fields
Only the following fields are supported. Any other fields mentioned in the user query must be ignored.

- SO Number (String): Must be extracted whenever mentioned.
- Customer PO (String): Must be extracted whenever mentioned.
- GTN PO (String): Must be extracted whenever mentioned.
- GTN PO Item (String): Must be extracted whenever mentioned.
- Batch ID (String): Must be extracted whenever mentioned.
- Request ID (String)
- Related Request (String): Accepts only `"true"` or `"false"` as values.

（3） Handling Multiple Conditions
When the user specifies multiple valid filter conditions within a single message, combine all key-value pairs into a single JSON string within the array.

Example
User Message: "I want to make a decision on SO 10002 with Batch ID 670970147098014"

Output:
"filters": [
  "{\"SO Number\": \"10002\", \"Batch ID\": \"670970147098014\"}"
]

 Handling Multiple Values for the Same Key
If the user provides multiple values for the same filter key, process only the first occurrence and ignore subsequent ones.

Example
User Message: "I want to make decision on SO 12323532 and SO 70140914901"

Output:

"filters": [
  "{\"SO Number\": \"12323532\"}"
]
*(Note: The second value "70140914901" is ignored because a value for "SO Number" has already been processed.)* This rule applies to all supported fields.

6 Examples & Edge Cases

Example 1: Decision-making Phrase
User Message: "I wanna make a decision on GTN PO 4509871234"
Output:
"filters": [
  "{\"GTN PO\": \"4509871234\"}"
]

Example 2: Multiple Valid Keywords
User Message: "Make decision for Customer PO CPO-2024-001 and Batch ID BATCH-789"
Output:
"filters": [
  "{\"Customer PO\": \"CPO-2024-001\", \"Batch ID\": \"BATCH-789\"}"
]

7. Summary of Key Rules
（1）Source: Extract only from the current user message. Never use historical context.
（2）Trigger: Extraction is triggered by "make decision" phrases **OR** the presence of specific mandatory keywords (`SO Number`, `Customer PO`, `GTN PO`, `GTN PO Item`, `Batch ID`, `Related Request`).
（3）Format: Output filters as an array containing a single, combined JSON string of all valid key-value pairs.
（4）Deduplication: For any key provided multiple times, use only the first value provided.
（5）Validation: Strictly include only the supported fields listed in Section 3.
（6）State Awareness: Correctly handle the special flags (`confirmAll`, `abort`, `removeAll`) as defined.

Implementation Checklist
- Extract filters **only** from the current user message.
- Verify the message contains a "make decision" phrase **OR** a mandatory keyword.
- Validate and include **only** the supported fields.
- Combine all valid conditions from the message into **one** JSON string within the array.
- For duplicate keys, use the **first** provided value and ignore the rest.
- Correctly apply the logic for `confirmAll`, `abort`, and `removeAll` states.

   (c) Array Item Type: String
   (d) Array Item Description:a JSON object string contain filter keys and value

14. decisions: 
   (a) Type: Array
   (b) Description:
   Overview
The `decisions` array contains decision parameters extracted from the current user message. This extraction occurs only when the user is explicitly making an approval or rejection decision.

1. Extraction Logic
Trigger Condition
Extract decisions from the current user message if and only if:
- The message contains words or phrases indicating a decision action, such as: `"approve"`, `"reject"`, `"approval"`, `"rejection"`, `"confirm approval"`, `"confirm reject"`

If these conditions are not met, do not extract any decisions.

Format：
The extracted decisions must be formatted as an array of JSON strings:
"decisions": ["{\"Request ID\":\"value\",\"Approver Decision\":\"value\",\"Approver Comment\":\"value\"}"]
Required Fields
Each decision object must include the following three fields:
1. `Request ID` (String): The unique identifier of the request being decided upon.
2. `Approver Decision` (String): The decision outcome. Must be either `"Approved"` or `"Rejected"`.
3. `Approver Comment` (String): Any comment or reason provided by the user. Extract this from the user's input text. If no comment is provided, set to an empty string `""`.

Special Cases
- No decision input: If the user's message does not contain approval/rejection actions, set `"decisions": null`
- Multiple decisions: If the user makes decisions on multiple requests in one message, each decision should be a separate JSON string within the array.
- When confirmAll = true, decisions = []; When userAction = "abort", decisions = []; When removeAll = true, decisions =[]
2. Extraction Priority

Primary Rule
When the user's query contains `"approve"` or `"reject"` keywords, the system must:
- Extract parameters into the `decisions` array
- Not extract these same parameters into the `filters` array

Mutual Exclusivity
- `filters` and `decisions` arrays are **mutually exclusive for the same parameters
- Decision-related parameters (`Request ID`, `Approver Decision`, `Approver Comment`) should **never** appear in the `filters` array

3. Examples

Example 1: Basic Approval
User Message: "I approve RD89982cd148314c3e85f1_110, with the consent of Simon and Matthew as well."

Output:
"decisions": ["{\"Request ID\":\"RD89982cd148314c3e85f1_110\",\"Approver Decision\":\"Approved\",\"Approver Comment\":\"with the consent of Simon and Matthew\"}"]

Example 2: Simple Rejection
User Message: "I reject request ID REQ-2024-001"

Output:
"decisions": ["{\"Request ID\":\"REQ-2024-001\",\"Approver Decision\":\"Rejected\",\"Approver Comment\":\"\"}"]

Example 3: Multiple Requests
User Message: "Approve REQ001 and REQ002 due to compliance"

Output:
"decisions": [
  "{\"Request ID\":\"REQ001\",\"Approver Decision\":\"Approved\",\"Approver Comment\":\"due to compliance\"}",
  "{\"Request ID\":\"REQ002\",\"Approver Decision\":\"Approved\",\"Approver Comment\":\"due to compliance\"}"
]

4. Processing Rules
Request ID Extraction
- Extract the Request ID value that appears closest to the approval/rejection verb
- Request IDs may be alphanumeric and can include underscores, hyphens, or other standard identifier characters

Decision Type Determination
- Map user words to standardized values:
  - `"approve"`, `"approval"`, `"confirm approve"` → `"Approved"`
  - `"reject"`, `"rejection"`, `"deny"`, `"decline"` → `"Rejected"`

Comment Extraction
- Extract any text following the Request ID as the comment
- Remove redundant phrases like "with the comment of" or "reason:"
- If the user provides no comment beyond the Request ID, set to empty string

5. Summary of Key Rules
1. Trigger: Extract only when user message contains `approve`/`reject` keywords
2. Exclusivity: Decision parameters go to `decisions` array, not `filters` array
3. Required Fields: Must include `Request ID`, `Approver Decision`, `Approver Comment`
4. Format: Array of JSON strings with exact field names

Implementation Checklist
- Check for `approve`/`reject` keywords in user message
- Extract Request ID value
- Determine decision type (`Approved` or `Rejected`)
- Extract any user comments
- Format as JSON string with required fields
- Place in `decisions` array (not `filters`)

(c) Array Item Type: String
(d) Array Item Description:include "Request ID", "Approver Decision", "Approver Comment"
