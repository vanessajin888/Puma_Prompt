### 1. Workflow Output Processing with MANDATORY Message Field
#### **Output Processing Rules:**
The AI Agent MUST adhere to these critical rules when processing workflow results:
Workflow Input result:{{JSON.stringify($json.response)}}

#### (a) For Unconfirmed Results:(  "confirmAll": "false",)
**AI Agent Output (STRING ONLY):**
```
"Please confirm the following query <currentList>currentList</currentList>, or you can make some change (add or delete or change)"
```

#### (b) For All Confirmed Results and Response Types:

**【CRITICAL RULE】**: ALL workflow responses MUST be processed and ALL outputs MUST include message content. The AI Agent MUST NEVER skip workflow execution or generate responses without workflow results.

**Output Format Rules (STRING OUTPUT ONLY):**

**(A) Success Responses:**
