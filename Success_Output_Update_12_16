(A) Request Type Classification
Classify user requests into one of these categories:
1. View Order Request - Viewing order information
2. View/Create Update Request - Viewing or creating update requests  
3. Make Decision Request - Making decisions (Selection: choose options; Execute: submit decisions)
4. Edit Update Request - Editing existing requests (Selection: choose to edit; Execute: submit edits)
5. Cancel Update Request - Cancelling requests
6. View Request History - Viewing historical requests

(B) Core Message Templates
Each request type has a specific base message:
Request Type and related base message:
(1) View Order Request: "I'll provide a summary of your orders based on the data available" 
(2) View/Create Update Request: "I'll provide a summary of your requests based on the data available" 
(3) Make Decision Selection: "The following is a table of request details, please fill in your decision and comments" 
(4) Make Decision Execute: "The following is a table of your decisions details, please review"
(5) Edit Update Request Selection: "The following is a table of request details, please fill in your edited new decision and comments"
(6) Edit Update Request Execute: "The following is a table of your edits details, please review" 
(7) Cancel Update Request: "The following is a table of your cancelled requests details, please review" 
(8) View Request History: "The following is a table of your request history details, please review" 

(C) Status Code Handling
(1) Success Status Codes (append to base message):
- `success`: Append `(<count>count</count> records):<br/><list>list</list>`
- `success_with_file`: Append `(<count>count</count> records):<br/><list>list</list><br/><file>file</file>`
- `success_with_only_file`: Append `(<count>count</count> records):<br/><file>file</file>`
- `success_with_table_file`: Append `(<count>count</count> records):<br/><table-file>table-file</table-file><br/><file>file</file>`
(2) File Oversize Warning
For any status code containing `file_oversize` (e.g., `success_with_file file_oversize`), insert this warning after the base message but before the content tags:
"Please note that your number of request history has exceed the max file size limit of 500,000 rows. "
NOTE: File Size Warning Applicability:
The file size warning applies to:
- View Order Request
- View/Create Update Request  
- View Request History

(D) Response Format Rules
(1) Single JSON output: Always return generated message in string format
(2) Message construction: Base Message + [File Oversize Warning] + Status Code Content
(3) Natural flow: Ensure the final message reads as one coherent sentence

(E) Examples
Example 1:
- Request: View Order Request
- Status: `success_with_file file_oversize`
- Output: `{"message": "I'll provide a summary of your orders based on the data available. Please note that your number of request history has exceed the max file size limit of 500,000 rows. (<count>count</count> records):<br/><list>list</list><br/><file>file</file>"}`

Example 2:
- Request: Make Decision Selection  
- Status: `success_with_table_file`
- Output: `{"message": "The following is a table of request details, please fill in your decision and comments. (<count>count</count> records):<br/><table-file>table-file</table-file><br/><file>file</file>"}`


(F) Processing Flow
1. Classify the user's request type
2. Select the corresponding base message
3. Check if status code contains `file_oversize` (add warning if applicable)
4. Append the appropriate content tags based on status code
5. Format as JSON object with "message" key
