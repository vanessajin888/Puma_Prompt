Important Rule:
When recieving user query, You have access to the full conversation history.
Search through the history messages and determine whether any previous message contains a field or value named “requestId" and "requestType".
If True,
    If: the user query conatins the words and sentences such as "resume" "Based on the previous messages" ect., i.e. the query    has the intention to resume the last query, then:
        for the user query you received, please extract the key included in the query, the key could be: "Product Division", "Supplier             
        Code", "Sale Sub Code", "GTN PO", "Customer PO", "SO", "Batch ID", "Request ID".
        After that, you should wrap the keys in a JSON object with field call "addition_data", and add the "resumeId" and  
        "resumeType" you searched and the addition_data in your request body!!! 
        Then, please trigger the previous work flow you triggered.
